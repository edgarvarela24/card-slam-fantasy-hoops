- Custom lineup creation
- Leaderboards and player rankings

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Yarn package manager
- Firebase account

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
3. Set up your Firebase configuration (see [Firebase Setup Guide](docs/FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md))
4. Run `yarn dev` to start development server

### Environment Configuration
The project requires the following environment variables in a `.env` file:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

## Development Workflow

### Development Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests first, then implement features
- **Clean Code**: Minimal, readable code with limited comments
- **SOLID, DRY, KISS**: Follow established software principles
- **Functional React**: Prefer functional components with hooks
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript throughout the codebase

### TDD Workflow
1. Write failing tests first for new functionality
2. Implement the minimal code necessary to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Mark checklist items as complete once tests pass
5. Run the full test suite periodically to check for regressions
6. Keep commits small and focused on specific features

### Code Review Guidelines
- All code must have corresponding tests
- Maintain TypeScript type safety (no `any` types)
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Address all ESLint warnings and errors
- Ensure accessibility standards are met

### Important Reminders
- ‚úÖ Check off completed items in this file after implementation
- üß™ Run all tests before moving to a new task to detect regressions
- üìù Update todo list regularly to maintain accurate project status

## Firebase Implementation
<!-- SECTION: FIREBASE -->

### Firebase Core Services

The app uses the following Firebase services:

1. **Authentication** - For user account management and sign-in
2. **Firestore** - For structured data storage (player cards, lineups, etc.)
3. **Realtime Database** - For real-time updates and live data
4. **Cloud Functions** - For server-side operations and background tasks

### Firebase File Structure

```
src/firebase/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.ts             # Authentication methods (signIn, signUp, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database.ts         # Realtime Database operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firebase.ts         # Firebase initialization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firestore.ts        # Firestore database operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.ts           # Firebase configuration (loads from .env)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts            # Exports all Firebase modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AuthContext.tsx     # React context for auth state
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ functions/          # Cloud Functions client interfaces
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ functions.ts    # Client-side function calling utilities
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts        # Example function implementations
```

### Testing Firebase Services

All Firebase services are tested through:

1. **Firebase Status Component** - Visual indication of Firebase connection
2. **Validate Firebase Script** - Command-line validation of Firebase configuration
3. **Test Firebase Script** - End-to-end testing of all Firebase services
4. **Unit Tests** - Tests for each Firebase service implementation

### Firebase Commands
```bash
# Setup Firebase configuration interactively
yarn setup:firebase

# Validate Firebase configuration
yarn validate:firebase

# Test Firebase connectivity
yarn test:firebase
```

### Firebase Development Guidelines

When working on Firebase features:

1. Ensure `.env` file has the correct Firebase configuration
2. Run `yarn validate:firebase` to verify config is correct
3. Use abstraction layers in `src/firebase/` instead of directly using Firebase
4. Test both online and offline scenarios when applicable
5. Follow security best practices for Firestore rules
6. Minimize database reads/writes for optimal performance

## Architecture
<!-- SECTION: ARCHITECTURE -->

### Frontend Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Components Layer**: Reusable UI components
   - Presentational components (cards, buttons, forms)
   - Container components (manage state and data flow)

2. **Services Layer**: Business logic and API interactions
   - Firebase service adapters
   - Third-party API integrations
   - Data transformation utilities

3. **Context Layer**: Global state management
   - Authentication context
   - User data context
   - Collection/Game state context

4. **Types Layer**: TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
   - Shared data models
   - API response types
   - Component prop types

### Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow:
1. User actions trigger events
2. Events are handled by context or local state
3. Services perform necessary data operations
4. State updates trigger re-renders
5. UI reflects the new state

## Testing Strategy
<!-- SECTION: TESTING -->

We employ a comprehensive testing approach:

- **Unit Tests**: For individual functions, hooks, and utilities
  - Focus on pure functions and business logic
  - High test coverage for core functionality

- **Component Tests**: For UI elements using React Testing Library
  - Test rendering, user interactions, and state changes
  - Verify accessibility compliance

- **Integration Tests**: For feature workflows
  - Test how components work together
  - Verify data flow through the application

- **E2E Tests**: For critical user journeys
  - Test complete user flows from end to end
  - Verify application works as a whole

- **Performance Tests**: For real-time updates
  - Test responsiveness under load
  - Verify real-time data synchronization

### Test Coverage Targets
- Core utilities: 95%+
- Components: 85%+
- Integration: 70%+
- Overall coverage: 80%+
