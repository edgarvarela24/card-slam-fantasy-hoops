# Card Slam Fantasy Hoops

## Project Overview
A modern, addictive fantasy basketball game with collectible player cards and real-time updates.

## Development Philosophy
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Write tests first, then implement features
- Clean, minimal code with limited comments
- Follow SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## TDD Workflow
1. Write failing tests first for new functionality
2. Implement the minimal code necessary to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Mark checklist items as complete once tests pass
5. Run the full test suite periodically to check for regressions
6. Keep commits small and focused on specific features

## Important Reminders
- ‚úÖ Check off completed items in this file after implementation
- üß™ Run all tests before moving to a new task to detect regressions
- üìù Update todo list regularly to maintain accurate project status

## Firebase Services Implementation

### Firebase Core Services

The app uses the following Firebase services:

1. **Authentication** - For user account management and sign-in
2. **Firestore** - For structured data storage (player cards, lineups, etc.)
3. **Realtime Database** - For real-time updates and live data
4. **Cloud Functions** - For server-side operations and background tasks

### Firebase File Structure

```
src/firebase/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.ts             # Authentication methods (signIn, signUp, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database.ts         # Realtime Database operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firebase.ts         # Firebase initialization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firestore.ts        # Firestore database operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.ts           # Firebase configuration (loads from .env)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts            # Exports all Firebase modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AuthContext.tsx     # React context for auth state
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ functions/          # Cloud Functions client interfaces
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ functions.ts    # Client-side function calling utilities
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts        # Example function implementations
```

### Testing Firebase Services

All Firebase services are tested through:

1. **Firebase Status Component** - Visual indication of Firebase connection
2. **Validate Firebase Script** - Command-line validation of Firebase configuration
3. **Test Firebase Script** - End-to-end testing of all Firebase services
4. **Unit Tests** - Tests for each Firebase service implementation

### For Development

When working on Firebase features:

1. Ensure `.env` file has the correct Firebase configuration
2. Run `yarn validate:firebase` to verify config is correct
3. Use abstraction layers in `src/firebase/` instead of directly using Firebase
4. Test both online and offline scenarios when applicable
