   - Understand architectural constraints
   - Consider dependencies between features

3. Task breakdown:
   - Break feature into granular tasks
   - Estimate complexity of each task
   - Identify prerequisites and dependencies

4. Implementation sequencing:
   - Order tasks for optimal development flow
   - Group related tasks when appropriate
   - Plan for incremental testing

5. Testing strategy:
   - Define test criteria for each task
   - Plan for unit, integration, and e2e tests
   - Consider edge cases and failure modes

6. Create implementation checklist:
   - List all tasks with clear success criteria
   - Add checkboxes for tracking progress
   - Include testing requirements for each item

7. Update roadmap document:
   - Add new tasks to appropriate section
   - Ensure proper formatting and structure
