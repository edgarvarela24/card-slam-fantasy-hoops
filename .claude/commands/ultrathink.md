# Ultrathink Deep Analysis

Apply maximum thinking resources to deeply analyze: $ARGUMENTS

## Deep Analysis Process:

Using maximum 31,999 thinking token budget, analyze the problem from multiple angles:

1. Problem Decomposition:
   - Break down the complex issue into manageable components
   - Identify key decision points and dependencies
   - Map relationships between different parts

2. Alternative Approaches:
   - Generate at least 3 completely different approaches
   - Evaluate each approach against requirements
   - Consider hybrid solutions that combine benefits

3. Implementation Complexity:
   - Assess development effort required
   - Identify potential technical challenges
   - Consider maintenance and extensibility concerns

4. Performance Analysis:
   - Evaluate computational complexity
   - Identify potential bottlenecks
   - Consider scaling implications

5. Technical Debt Assessment:
   - Evaluate impact on existing codebase
   - Consider refactoring opportunities
   - Identify patterns to establish or enforce

6. Testing Strategy:
   - Outline comprehensive testing approach
   - Identify edge cases and failure modes
   - Define success criteria and validation methods

7. Decision Matrix:
   - Create weighted comparison of approaches
   - Highlight tradeoffs between options
   - Make clear recommendation with reasoning

8. Implementation Plan:
   - Create detailed plan with specific steps
   - Define milestones and checkpoints
   - Identify risks and mitigation strategies
