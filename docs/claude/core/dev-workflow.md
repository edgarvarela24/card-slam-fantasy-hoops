# Development Workflow & Philosophy

## Development Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests first, then implement features
- **Clean Code**: Minimal, readable code with limited comments
- **SOLID, DRY, KISS**: Follow established software principles
- **Functional React**: Prefer functional components with hooks
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript throughout the codebase

## TDD Workflow
1. Write failing tests first for new functionality
2. Implement the minimal code necessary to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Mark checklist items as complete once tests pass
5. Run the full test suite periodically to check for regressions
6. Keep commits small and focused on specific features
