# Card Slam Fantasy Hoops: Project Overview

## Concept
Card Slam Fantasy Hoops is a modern fantasy basketball application that reimagines the traditional fantasy sports experience by combining collectible card game mechanics with real-time NBA statistics. Players open digital packs of cards featuring basketball players, build lineups, and compete on leaderboards based on their players' real-world performance.

## Core Value Propositions
- **Pack Opening Experience**: Creating the "OH SHIT I GOT LEBRON!" moment of excitement
- **Card Collection & Progression**: Building and improving your collection over time
- **Real-Time Updates**: Watching scores change live without refreshing
- **Special Abilities**: Cards with unique powers that modify scoring (e.g., 2x points on 3-pointers)
- **Leaderboard Competition**: Competing against other players for ranking and rewards

## Target Audience
- NBA fans aged 18-45
- Fantasy sports enthusiasts looking for a fresh experience
- Collectible card game players
- Casual sports fans who want a simpler entry to fantasy sports

## Monetization Strategy
1. **Primary**: Pack purchases with premium currency
2. **Secondary**: Conversion of unwanted cards into "Basketball Points" (BP) used to craft specific cards
3. **Tertiary**: Optional premium battle pass with exclusive rewards

## Unique Differentiators
- **Solo-friendly**: No draft required; play on your own schedule
- **Card Variants**: Different versions of the same player with unique abilities
- **Real-time Updates**: Live scoring and leaderboard updates during games
- **Simplified Onboarding**: Easy to understand for fantasy newcomers
