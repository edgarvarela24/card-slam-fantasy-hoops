# Test-Driven Development Approach

## TDD Philosophy

For Card Slam Fantasy Hoops, we're adopting a rigorous test-driven development (TDD) approach to ensure high-quality code, maintainable architecture, and reliable functionality.

### Core Principles

1. **Write Tests First**: Tests are written before implementation code
2. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Make tests fail first, write code to pass, then refactor
3. **Small Iterations**: Develop in small, testable increments
4. **Full Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage of all features
5. **Automated Testing**: Tests run automatically on every build

### Benefits for This Project

- **Reliability**: Critical for a real-time application with live data
- **Refactorability**: Allows for safe refactoring as the app evolves
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior
- **Design Quality**: TDD naturally leads to better, more modular design
- **Developer Confidence**: Safer implementation of new features

## The TDD Workflow

1. **Understand the requirement** clearly before writing any code
2. **Write a failing test** that defines the expected behavior
   - Test should be minimal but meaningful
   - Avoid testing trivial implementations (like `1 + 1 = 2`)
   - Focus on testing the contract/interface, not implementation details
3. **Implement the minimal code** to make the test pass
   - Write just enough code to make the test pass
   - Don't implement features not covered by tests
4. **Refactor** while keeping tests passing
   - Improve code design without changing behavior
   - Run tests after each refactoring step

## Common TDD Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Writing Trivial Tests
Trivial tests that would pass with no implementation are not helpful:

```typescript
// BAD: Would pass even with no real implementation
test('Card component renders', () => {
  const card = { id: '123', name: 'Test' };
  render(<Card card={card} />);
  expect(document.body).not.toBeNull();
});

// GOOD: Tests actual component behavior
test('Card component displays player name', () => {
  const card = {
    id: '123',
    name: 'LeBron James',
    team: 'LAL',
    position: 'SF',
  };
  
  render(<Card card={card} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('LeBron James')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 2. Testing Implementation Details
Tests should focus on behavior, not implementation:
```typescript
// BAD: Tests implementation details
test('Card uses useState hook', () => {
  const useStateSpy = jest.spyOn(React, 'useState');
  render(<Card card={{ id: '123', name: 'Test' }} />);
  expect(useStateSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();
});

// GOOD: Tests behavior that matters to users
test('Card shows rarity indicator for legendary cards', () => {
  const card = {
    id: '123',
    name: 'LeBron James',
    rarity: 'Legendary'
  };
  
  render(<Card card={card} />);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('legendary-indicator')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 3. Over-mocking
Mock only what's necessary:
```typescript
// BAD: Over-mocking everything
test('CardService gets cards', async () => {
  const mockFirebase = {
    getDocument: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({}),
    // Mocking many methods not used in the test
    updateDocument: jest.fn(),
    deleteDocument: jest.fn(),
    queryDocuments: jest.fn(),
  };
  
  const cardService = new CardService(mockFirebase);
  await cardService.getCardById('123');
  
  expect(mockFirebase.getDocument).toHaveBeenCalled();
});

// GOOD: Mock only what's needed
test('CardService gets cards', async () => {
  const mockGetDocument = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    id: '123',
    name: 'LeBron James',
  });
  
  const cardService = new CardService({ getDocument: mockGetDocument });
  const card = await cardService.getCardById('123');
  
  expect(mockGetDocument).toHaveBeenCalledWith('cards/123');
  expect(card.name).toBe('LeBron James');
});
```
### Test Coverage Goals

Core utilities: 95%+
Components: 85%+
Integration: 70%+
Overall coverage: 80%+

Remember: The primary goal is not 100% coverage but meaningful coverage of important functionality and edge cases.
